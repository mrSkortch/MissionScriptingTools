- error messages adjusted in mist.debug.dump_G and mist.debug.write_data

- mist.demos.printAngles now accepts unitname string input variable

- added mist.DBs.units_by_cat (units by category, such as ship, plane, vehicle, helicopter, static).  Inside each category, units indexed numerically.

- added mist.DBs.units_by_num - units, indexed numerically (BUT NOT BY unitId!).

- added mist.DBs.alive_units - indexed by runtime id_, contains all the alive units (not static objects) (same info as in the other DBs), 
  PLUS the alive unit's Unit object, and Pos3 position.  Updated no less frequently than once per second.
     
	 - added update_alive_units coroutine to populate this table.
	 - modified mist.main to run this coroutine.
	(NOTE TO SELF: May need to make an old_alive_units table too)

- mist.DBs.dead_objects table added- table of dead objects, indexed by runtime id_.  
	Example entries:
	mist.DBs.dead_objects = {
		[11553252] = {
			object = { id_ = 11553252 },
			objectType = 'vehicle',
			objectData = { ..... }, -- the same data contained in the alive_units entry for this vehicle
			Pos = {x = -562214.67543, y = 2243.4221, z = 1150221.54514 }, -- Position the vehicle died at.
		},
		[16231153] = {
			object = { id_ = 16231153 },
			objectType = 'static',
			objectData = { ..... }, -- the same data contained in the regular DBs for this static object
			Pos = {x = -6423121.23342, y = 152.1231, z = 1055212.331 }, --Position the static object died at.
		},
		[123555223] = {
			object = { id_ = 123555223 },
			objectType = 'building',
			Pos = {x = -505213.5532, y = 531.3365, z = 10733913.33214 }, --Position the map object died at
		},
		[21255292] = {
			object = { id_ = 21255292 },  -- object that could be be correlated to a unit, or a static object, and that getPosition failed on.
			objectType = 'unknown',
		},
	}
	
	- added default event handler to add objects to mist.dead_objects
	- modified __newindex metamethod for mist.DBs.dead_objects to derive dead object properites
